# Predicting Bank Customer Churn - A Machine Learning Approach

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict bank customer churn based on a dataset of customer profiles and their banking activity. The goal is to identify patterns that signal when a customer is likely to leave the bank so that interventions can be made to improve customer retention.

## Data
The analysis is based on a dataset provided as part of a Kaggle competition. It includes various customer attributes, such as demographics, account details, and transaction history.

## Methodology
The project utilizes a range of machine learning techniques for binary classification, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. Key performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are used to assess model performance.

## Results
The final model demonstrates a strong ability to predict customer churn, with a balance between sensitivity and specificity. This suggests the model's practical utility in a real-world business context.
